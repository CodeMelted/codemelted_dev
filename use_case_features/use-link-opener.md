# User Story

**`WHO:`** As a software developer

**`WHAT:`** I want the ability to open URL links

**`WHY:`** So that the default native application associated with that link is opened separate from my application.

**`ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:`**

1. When I am able to open a file with its associated native program (i.e. .docx opens in MS word if installed).
2. When I am able to open a website via the native web browser.
3. When I am able to open the default email program and fill in the to, cc, bcc, subject, and body of the message.
4. When I am able to open the default phone application to dial a specified phone number.
5. When I am able to open the default texting application when specifying a number to send an sms message.

# Design Notes

- Flutter module handles this and not dart.  There was also a need to separate the module exceptions to be specific to them.  Could not reuse the `UseCaseFailure` between both modules
- This use case would also apply to web, not sure how this will apply to other modules.
- In researching how to implement this use case in `pwsh` and `C++`, it appears you simply pass the link to a process which would in theory utilize the associated native program.  Something to test for sure.
