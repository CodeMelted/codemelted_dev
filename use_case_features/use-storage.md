# User Story

**`WHO:`** As a software developer

**`WHAT:`** I want the ability to manage dictionary data

**`WHY:`** So that my app has quick access to key / value pairs of information between restart of the application.  In addition, upon startup, the system environment of variables should also be loaded as part of the dictionary.

**`ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:`**

1. When a copy of the system environment is loaded for query or runtime update.  NOTE: this will only be in effect during the runtime.
2. When a string key / value pair can be set to the storage indicating its success and failure.
3. When a string value can be can be retrieved with a key from local storage.  null is returned if not found.
4. When the storage can remove a key entry indicating success or failure
5. When the storage can clear the entire storage indicating success or failure.

# Design Notes

- This is a `flutter` module feature as it relies on WidgetBindings.  The `flutter` module will not load a system environment upon startup of the web target.
