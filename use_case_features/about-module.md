**`ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:`**

You just want to know what it is you are using.

```
TITLE:    melt_the_code_[sdk] Module
VERSION:  v0.0.0 (Released on dd mmm yyyy)
WEBSITE:  https://codemeled.dev/melt_the_code_[sdk]
LICENSE:  MIT / © yyyy Mark Shaffer. All Rights Reserved.

```

## 2.0 Design Notes

- For Flutter / Dart, the method names will be `aboutFlutterModule()` and `aboutDartModule()` respectively as flutter cannot override dart via an extension.
- All other module SDKs will implement `aboutModule()` in their respective syntax.
