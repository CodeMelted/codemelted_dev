# User Story

**`WHO:`** As a software developer

**`WHAT:`** I want the ability to query runtime environment parameters

**`WHY:`** So that application behavior can be affected based on those parameters

**`ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:`**

1. When at a minimum, the following runtime environment parameters can be queried:
   - eol
   - hostname
   - isBrowser
   - isDesktop
   - isMobile
   - numberOfProcessors
   - osName
   - osVersion
   - pathSeparator
2. When in addition, performance metrics can be gathered to monitor the environment.  This includes:
   - cpuUsed
   - memoryUsed
   - totalMemoryAvailable

# Design Notes

- This is a `dart` only implementation.
- `C++` and `pwsh` should be able to implement AC #2.  Will need to research to determine whether `dart` and `web` can do this.
- All languages will be able to implement AC #1.
