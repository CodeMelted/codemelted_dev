<li><strong>Automated Forklift / Pallet Jack System:</strong> Integrated a set of smart / dumb sensors for obstruction detection via the fork tips.  These sensors connected via IO-Link Master bridge connecting via Ethernet/IP and Modbus/TCP industrial protocols to feed their data into the overall single board computer system.  This made use of C++ 17 standard with Python for utility programs and automated testing.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Home IoT Integration:</strong> Refactored a cloud IoT backend for smart appliances from a mix of Python and NodeJS to TypeScript Node codebase for use on the Google Cloud Platform, specifically Firebase.  This provided a new consistent backend codebase.  Upgrade the website and mobile apps into a Flutter app consolidating those into a singular code base from REACT Native.  Also implemented AWS and Google Smart Home skills to interact with the smart home appliances.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Tracking Mobile Application:</strong> Built an asset tracking mobile application in Flutter SDK. This application targeted both Android and iOS. The application was a client to AWS cloud endpoints gathering and updating asset data via GraphQL and REST APIs. The assets were displayed on a Google Map for real-time tracking and getting directions to different trackers. The assets were also managed via a sortable table. The application also had the ability to provision assets via BLE allowing for direct updating of an asset and gather information about it. The application could also generate and email reports. These were the subset requirements from the overall web portal requirements to support customers in the field.</li>
<li><strong>Cross Platform Mobile Framework Evaluation:</strong> Did a broad analysis of all technologies related to targeting multiple platforms to determine our best recommendations to our clients. The main targets were Android and iOS with other targets of web, desktop, and IoT evaluated. This consisted of setting up build toolchains along with writing demo apps utilizing different required technologies. Results of this report now allows for picking the right solution for the job to betters support clients.</li>
<li><strong>Docker Server Suite:</strong> Performed systems engineering for a project.  The system is a suite of Docker container images (some custom builds, some from Docker repository) joined with a Python flask gateway application.  Users can completely access services via a custom web application.  Part of the systems engineering was a refactor of the installation process to allow for upgrading aspects of the system instead of a full installation.  Other parts include identifying user stories to bring this to a deliverable project hosting within the cloud or on physical hardware along with establishing the existing design and creating a coding standard for scripts.  Scripts to perform other tasks were written within Python and bash with a set coding standard for those.</li>
<li><strong>User Database Migration:</strong> An air conditioner company was migrating their cloud-based system from AWS to GCP solution.  Part of this migration was the moving user / device data from Xively database to a Firebase Cloud Firestore.  A TypeScript utility was written to make API calls from the old AWS endpoints to transfer the data into the Firebase Cloud Firestore system.</li>
<li><strong>Django Endpoints and Test API Framework:</strong> Part 2 to the Django Demo Capability is the establishment of API endpoints and the ability to validate those endpoints for non-degradation / performance testing.  The API endpoints were developed in Django Python interfacing with business logic working with a Postgres database.  API documentation was auto generated via swagger.io.  Finally, all documentation hosting, Django admin pages, and the demo application completely share a custom look and feel for a light and dark theme.  The Test API Framework was developed in Python 3 CLI app utilizing the requests and tabulate python modules.  The framework was compiled into an executable to work on Mac OS/ Windows OS.  The framework would utilize JSON test input files to validate expected returns from API calls along with measuring how long the calls took.  This was summarized in a metrics report.  All of this was to support the Django Endpoints into other systems the client was supporting.</li>
<li><strong>Django Demo Capability:</strong> Upgraded a Django web application hosted in the Google Cloud Platform to have a dynamic demo capability for on-stage expos.  This demo required a facilitator on stage to utilize the web application to demonstrate the web applications features while supporting ~500 concurrently connected audience members.  This required an architecture upgrade for the Django to utilize the ASGI protocol via the Channels framework.  Once upgraded, a web socket protocol was utilized to facilitate the demo capabilities.  The web application supported mobile and desktop views, D3 chart rendering, accessing a mobile device camera from the web application, and OCR capabilties via the Google Vision API.</li>
