# 1.0 Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

"Write once, run anywhere (WORA)" was the famous slogan made by Sun Microsystems in 1995.  At the time, this technology allowed for easy full stack engineering allowing you to target dedicated workstations and on premise servers. So long as a Java Runtime Environment existed, you could run your code.

Java was unable to keep to their slogan as web browsers became more advanced, mobile devices became ubiquitous, and companies no longer required dedicated servers.  Software engineers are now required to learn multiple languages, technologies, and frameworks in order to fully support full stack engineering.

This project aims to simplify by developing a set of cross platform modules implementing a similar / identical Application Program Interface (API) regardless of the chosen technology covered by this project.  This allows a developer to maximize their productivity because regardless of the technology, they are learning a similar module API for their solution.

## 1.2 Scope

The scope of this project is to deliver a set of cross platform modules that allow a developer to tackle the different technology stacks.  The chosen language SDKs described in the table below.

## 3.2 Testing

The following procedure represent the steps to confirm your setup of the previous section tooling worked and would also be used for any validation of changes made to this repo via the

### 3.2.1 Dev Site Validation

- [ ] Open a terminal to the repo
- [ ] Execute the command `./build.ps1 --dev-site` in the terminal window.  View the output and confirm no errors in the execution.
- [ ] Execute the command `cd dist` to bring you to the built output
- [ ] Execute the command `python3 -m http.server` to start a web server
- [ ] Open a web browser window and enter the address `http://[::]:8000/`.  You should see the DEV page rendered and all the links should work
